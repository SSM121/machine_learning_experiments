#Gender Guessing
This project is based off the following tutorial:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5pRlIbr6gg&list=PL2-dafEMk2A6QKz1mrk1uIGfHkC1zZ6UU&index=1 . 
This predicts gender given height weight (and shoe size for one of the 2 functions). The csv file comes from here: 
https://github.com/omairaasim/machine_learning/blob/master/project_9_predict_weight_sex/weight-height.csv .
If you run weightpredict.py you will see 2 tests ran. one with the csv and one with hardcoded values.
if you run main.py it will produce graphs and statistics for the 3 (or 4) different machine learning
solutions. The 4th is commented out due to very poor performance on my host machine. (10 minutes for a single test over the csv file) 
so I did not want to run that long test over 50 iterations. You can change the config.py file to alter how the tests are
ran.
